# NoGo Extension for Q-Sage

## Details
This repository simply contains all the code we made for generating the boards to solve NoGo using [Q-Sage](https://github.com/irfansha/Q-sage/tree/main).

### Why and How
Nothing really happens here, since most of the code is run using [Bloqqer](https://fmv.jku.at/bloqqer/) for pre-processing and [Qubi](https://github.com/jacopol/Qubi) for solving the encodings.
